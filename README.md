# Open source information security policies
Here's a set of documents you can use under open source licensing to kickstart your information security policy work.

Every company needs rules of the road to help it's staff, contractors, interns, etc understand what to do and not do to ensure a consistent security posture.

These are written such that they can become part of your employee handbook with an annual refresh/attestation signature.

Feel free to use these policies as is, or tailor them to your environment.
