# Incident Response Program
The company follows the SANS/NIST framework for security incident response consisting of the following phases:

## Preparation
In the preparation phase, likely security incidents are discussed and planned for ahead of time with a focus on making key decisions and decision points before finding oneself in the heat of an incident response effort. The company has identified the following scenarios as likely security incidents:

*list the likely incidents for your org*

## Identification
Incidents can be discovered from a variety of sources, manual or automated. The company has required incident reporting as part of itâ€™s internal security policy to ensure no incident occurs without proper escalation and handling.

Once identified, incidents are classified into the following categories:
- Abuse
- Application compromise
- Data corruption
- Data disclosure
- Defacement
- Denial of service
- Fraud
- Lost or stolen device
- Malware
- Phishing
- Unauthorized access
- Unauthorized use

*list any other categories specific to your org/industry*

## Containment
The goal of this phase is reducing the impact of the incident through proper containment. Incidents that occur or are expected to occur frequently will require automated containment measures.

## Eradication
In this phase, the company endeavors to remove the source or effects of the incident. Uninstalling malware, erasing phishing email from inboxes are examples of eradication measures that will be undertaken.

## Recovery
The goal of this phase is to return to normal business operations as soon as possible. The company also uses this phase to monitor for signs of recurrence, or unanticipated impacts of containment or recovery efforts.

## Lessons Learned
The goal of this phase is to never miss an opportunity to improve. Process, technology or other facilitating controls that helped or hindered are identified and remediation efforts are planned for future work streams.
